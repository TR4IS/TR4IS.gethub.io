        <h2>> Hey ðŸ‘‹ , Iâ€™m TRAIS!</h2>
        <p>
            Iâ€™m not a pro developer (yet...)<br>
            but Iâ€™m a hardworking self-learner<br>
            whoâ€™s obsessed with coding,
            cybersecurityðŸ”’<br> and making
            things run betterâš¡.<br><br><br>

            <big><b>> What I do :</b></big><br><br>


            I spend my time building java and python appsðŸ’»,<br>
            tweaking Windows performance 
            and diving into cybersecurity<br>
            because letâ€™s be honest...<br> nothing feels
            better than breaking things...
            ethically ;).<br><br><br>

            <big><b>> Daily learning :</b></big><br><br>

            I believe that skills come with time<br>
            but passion and persistence are what
            really matter<br> Every day, I learn
            something new<br> debug something
            frustrating ðŸ”¥<br> and push myself to be
            better than yesterday.<br><br><br>

            > Still learning, still growing,
            still coding! ðŸ”¥
